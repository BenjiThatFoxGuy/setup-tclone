# This is a test workflow used for testing BenjiThatFoxGuy/setup-tclone action if it works or not.
# This is not an example workflow that you will use to use setup-rclone.
# If you forked this repository in order to use setup-rclone, you are doing it wrong. You need to create your own repository and use it there.
# You are only going to use this if you help to develop, or create your own version of this action.
